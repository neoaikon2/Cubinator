## 1.0.0
  
Initial Release

## 1.0.1
  
Corrected modloader reference from bepinex to melonloader

## 1.0.2

Finalizing release -
- Removed nonfunctional OpenPNG (where did I even get that from??) figured out how to PROPERLY save
a png in Unity since they moved that functionality out of the Texture2D class into ImageConversion
- Fixed issue with keystroke detection, you had to basically hit CTRL+P simultaniously for it to work, but now it works properly
